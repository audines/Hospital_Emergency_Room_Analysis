## Project Overview
In this project,  we will be examining the efficiency and effectiveness of a hospital emergency room. 
The  goal is to enhance the quality of care provided in the emergency room and ensure that patients receive timely and appropriate treatment.
## Data 
Our  dataset Hospital ER.csv contains 9,216 entries and 11 columns. Below is a breakdown of its structure:

Columns and Data Types

 - date (object) - Timestamp of ER visit.
   
  - patient_id (object) - Unique patient identifier.
    
  - patient_gender (object) - Gender of the patient (M/F).
  
 - patient_age (int64) - Age of the patient.
 
 - patient_sat_score (float64) - Satisfaction score (missing for many entries).
 
 - patient_first_inital (object) - First initial of the patient’s name.
 
 - patient_last_name (object) - Last name of the patient.
 
 - patient_race (object) - Race of the patient.
 
 - patient_admin_flag (bool) - Whether the patient was admitted (True/False).
 
 - patient_waittime (int64) - Time spent waiting in minutes.
 
 - department_referral (object) - Department the patient was referred to (e.g., "General Practice", "Orthopedics").
  

## Business Case

A summary of essential metrics:

 -  Average Wait Time (Overall & by Department)
   
  - Median Wait Time
    
 -  Longest & Shortest Wait Time
   
 -  Percentage of Patients Admitted
   
 -  Satisfaction Score vs. Wait Times

## Visualization

My dashboard will include the following key visualizations and metrics to monitor ER wait times.

✅ KPIs (Avg. wait time, max wait time, etc.)

✅ Wait time distribution (Histogram)

✅ Wait time by department (Bar chart)

✅ Peak hours analysis (Line chart)

✅ Satisfaction vs. wait time (Scatter plot)

## Key Insights
ER wait time dashboard can help hospitals:

✅ Reduce congestion

✅ Improve patient satisfaction

✅ Optimize staffing levels

✅ Provide data-driven decision-making
