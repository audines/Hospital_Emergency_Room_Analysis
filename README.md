## Project Overview
In this project,  we will be examining the efficiency and effectiveness of a hospital emergency room. 
The  goal is to enhance the quality of care provided in the emergency room and ensure that patients receive timely and appropriate treatment.
## Data 

The dataset used in this project is available for download [[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1neSPTn65RZVu2Bi5b0ljJaOJMqq5O_k_XgjYR2A2YXw/edit?gid=0#gid=0)].

The dataset contains 9,216 entries and 11 columns. Below is a breakdown of its structure:

Columns and Data Types

 - date (object) - Timestamp of ER visit.
   
  - patient_id (object) - Unique patient identifier.
    
  - patient_gender (object) - Gender of the patient (M/F).
  
 - patient_age (int64) - Age of the patient.
 
 - patient_sat_score (float64) - Satisfaction score (missing for many entries).
 
 - patient_first_inital (object) - First initial of the patient‚Äôs name.
 
 - patient_last_name (object) - Last name of the patient.
 
 - patient_race (object) - Race of the patient.
 
 - patient_admin_flag (bool) - Whether the patient was admitted (True/False).
 
 - patient_waittime (int64) - Time spent waiting in minutes.
 
 - department_referral (object) - Department the patient was referred to.
  


Data is cleaned and a calculated field is defined in order to group patients accross different groups as ‚Äò0‚Äì18,‚Äô ‚Äò19‚Äì30,‚Äô ‚Äò31‚Äì65,‚Äô  and ‚Äô66 and above.‚Äô

## Visualization

The following Emergency Room wait time dashboard avalaible  [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ines.mbonda/viz/HospitalEmergencyRoomDashboard_17396810521090/Dashboard1) is important to monitor ER wait times in order to:

 - Reduce congestion

 - Improve patient satisfaction

 - Optimize staffing levels

 - Provide data-driven decision-making

Below is an overview of essential components of the dashboard:

1. **Total Number of Patients**: This metric indicates the overall patient volume within the ER over a specified period. This important in resource planning and identifying trends.

2. **Patient Demographics**:

     - **Gender Distribution**: Visualizing the proportion of male, female, and non-conforming gender patients aids in tailoring patient care services appropriately.

     -  **Age Distribution**: Categorizing patients into age groups (e.g., 0‚Äì18, 19‚Äì30, 31‚Äì65, 66 and above) provides insights into the predominant age brackets utilizing ER services.

  -   **Race/Ethnicity**: The racial and ethnic composition of patients can inform culturally competent care practices.

3. **Average Patient Wait Time**: Monitoring the average duration patients spend waiting before receiving care is crucial for assessing the efficiency of the ER.

4. **Patient Satisfaction Scores**: analyzing satisfaction ratings (on a scale of 0‚Äì10) helps gauge the quality of care from the patient's perspective. Identifying periods with lower satisfaction can prompt targeted improvements.

6. **Wait Time Analysis by Weekday and Hour**: Utilizing heatmaps to display average wait times across different days and hours can highlight peak periods.

7. **Patient Volume by Department Referral**: Analyzing which departments most frequently refer patients to the ER can identify areas with higher demand.

8. **Trends Over Time**: trends in patient visits, wait times, and satisfaction scores can reveal patterns, such as seasonal fluctuations or the impact of specific interventions.

9. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Incorporating KPIs like the total number of patients, average wait time, and average satisfaction score into the dashboard provides a quick snapshot of ER performance.


## Key Insights

üîç The Emergency room had 9,216 patients visits and the overall Average Satisfaction Score was 5.47 out of 10. 

üîç March 2020 was the month with the highest satisfaction score, reaching 5.32. October 2020 and April 2019 closely follow with scores of 5.31 and 5.30, respectively.

üîç During patient visits, the waiting time before a patient could see a practitioner was 35 minutes on average. February 2020 recorded the highest average wait time at 36.67 minutes, closely followed by August 2019 with 36.39 minutes. In contrast, October 2020 had the lowest wait time at 34.05 minutes, closely followed by September 2019 with 34.27 minutes.

üîç General Practice has the highest number of referrals (1,840),Orthopaedic followed with 995 patients  while the Renal department has the lowest (86).

üîç The three days and times with the highest wait times are 11 pm on Monday (40.39 minutes), 3 am on Wednesday (39.74 minutes), and 10 pm on Friday (39.34 minutes). Conversely, 1 am on Wednesday (29.65 minutes), 9 pm on Saturday (30.39 minutes), and 4 pm on Saturday (30.52 minutes) mark the days with the least wait times.

üîç The white race visited the hospital more which further indicate that the male gender visited the hospital more often.

## Recommandations

‚úÖ Resource Allocation: during peak wait times, particularly on Monday nights, Wednesday early mornings, and Friday nights,
additional staff  should be deployed  to reduce wait times and prevent staff burnout.

‚úÖProcess Improvement: workflows should be streamlined in departments with high referral rates ( General Practice, Orthopedic, and Physiotherapy) to enhance patient throughput.

‚úÖ Patient Experience Initiatives: Improving long wait times could enhance patient satisfaction. Investigate reasons for dissatisfaction and implement changes.

‚úÖ  Addressing the specific needs  of different gender groups will ensure an inclusive and responsive healthcare environment. 
For male patients, improve satisfaction in the renal department (average score of 4.5).  For female patients, address concerns in the Physiotherapy department (average score of 5.29).


Reduce Waiting Times





The average waiting time before patients can see a practitioner is 35 minutes. Consider streamlining processes, optimizing triage, and allocating resources efficiently to reduce waiting times.



Implement strategies such as fast-track lanes for less severe cases or using technology (e.g., appointment scheduling apps) to manage patient flow effectively.



Improve Late-Night Services





Since 34% of visits occur during late-night hours (11 PM to 6 AM), focus on maintaining high-quality services during these times by ensuring adequate staffing, maintain cleanliness, and providing timely care even during off-peak hours to enhance patient satisfaction.
